  <p><em>Last updated: 2025/03/10</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to all software programs, browser extensions, and digital products (collectively "Products")
    developed and distributed by Animoki SRL ("the Company"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your
    personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Our Products may collect and store data to provide and improve their functionality. The types of data we may collect include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Input:</strong> Information that you provide directly, such as names, email addresses, and other data entered into our Products.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferences and Settings:</strong> Information regarding your usage and configuration preferences, stored locally on your device or via browser storage mechanisms.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> Data such as browser type, operating system, and diagnostic data, which help us optimize performance and troubleshoot issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Use of Data</h2>
  <p>
    The data collected is used solely for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensuring proper functionality and automating processes within our Products.</li>
    <li>Saving and retrieving your preferences and settings to provide a more personalized experience.</li>
    <li>Communicating with external servers only when necessary for specific functionalities (for example, API calls to confirm transactions or updates).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not use your data for marketing, profiling, or any purposes beyond what is necessary for the operation and improvement of our Products.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    Data collected by our Products is primarily stored locally on your device or within secure storage provided by the platform (such as browser storage).
    When data is transmitted to external servers (e.g., for API calls), it is done over secure connections and only the minimal required information is transmitted.
  </p>
  <p>
    We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
